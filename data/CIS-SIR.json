By considering the impact, urgency, and priority, organizations can assess the severity of an incident and allocate appropriate resources and response efforts accordingly.\n\nWhile the cost of the response to the security breach (option A), the time taken to resolve the security incident (option C), and the business value of the affected asset (option D) may be important considerations in incident response, they are not direct influences on the severity field in ServiceNow's Security Incident module.
